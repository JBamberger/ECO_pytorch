# Pytorch ECO

Very stripped down implementation of the ECO tracking algorithm. The code is based on the [PyTracking][upstream] code.
The code is mostly untested. Use the PyTracking code directly if a working and maintained implementation of ECO is desired.

Many changes to the structure of the code were performed, to make it suitable for standalone usage.
